# Portfolio Website

My personal developer portfolio, built with **Vue 3** and **Tailwind CSS**. The 3D logo on the landing page was built from scratch with **Blender**.
The site showcases a progression of projects spanning the last 4+ years — starting with early **web development**, advancing through **.NET / C# development**, and most recently exploring **Unity game development**.
